<h3 id="index1" style="font-size:30px">2001 – Honda Activa 1st Generation<br></h3>
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The Honda Activa was launched in India in the year 2001 and caused a huge stir because it was one of the first two-wheelers to offer a gearless experience to the riders. The design was loosely based on the design of the geared scooter, the previously launched Honda Eterno. It was large and spacious but was light and zippy at the same time. There were large, comfortable seats and a long footrest area. These features made the first generation Honda Activa a raging success. The vehicle had become so popular that it started competing with geared motorcycles such as the Hero Honda Splendour. Since the scooter was marketed as a unisex vehicle, it grew further in popularity in the Indian markets. The vehicle was also extremely sturdy and many experts have commented that the first generation Activa was the sturdiest Activa among all models to date.

<h3 id="index2" style="font-size:30px">2009 – Activa 2G – A due upgrade:</h3>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp After a very successful run of eight long years, 
    the first generation Activa was upgraded. In the year 2009, Honda launched the Activa 2G model which was a new
    and improved version of the existing Activa model. The Activa 2G model had a 109.2cc engine which was quite powerful and
     capable of a top speed of over 80KM. The Activa 2G was among the first scooters in India to get a combi-brake system which made it a very safe bike to ride. Honda also extensively worked on the aesthetics of the new generation Activa. Some major design changes made the scooter look better and sleeker. The headlights and the taillights were upgraded. Also, the vehicle was now available in more colours and these factors made it more popular among the masses
     . The second-generation Activa scooters were in production till 2015 and so you can still spot an occasional one on the streets.
    </p>


<h3 id="index3" style="font-size:30px">2015 – Honda Activa 3G:</h3>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp In 2015 Honda announced the l
    aunch of the third-generation Activa scooters in India. The much-awaited Activa 3G model was unveiled at a time whe
    n Honda was receiving stiff competition from Hero Motocorp after the JV between the two companies ended. To stand up 
    to this competition, the Activa 3G was launched and this was the turning point in Activa’s history. The broad design has remained u
    nchanged ever since. The third-generation Activa was the first scooter to have a timeless tyre. This apart, it company implemented the Hon
    da Eco Technology in the engine of Activa 3G and this automatically led to higher mileage. As a huge milestone, the 8hp of power and a torq
    ue of 8.83Nm of the 109.2 credit card engine could take the scooter to a maximum speed of KMPH. The design was majorly revamped and there were
     more colours to choose from, the seats had better cushioning and the lights were more stylish than ever before.
    </p>


<h3 id="index4" style="font-size:30px">2017 – Activa 4G launched:</h3>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The 3G Activa was a path breaker and an innovation in many areas. T
    his is why Honda Motors didn't make too many alterations to it and there were some very minor changes in the 4G models
    , the most significant one being the BS4 engine. Apart from this, there weren't any major changes. The riders still found the s
    ame design, engine power and safety features as were found on the third-generation Honda Activa models launched just a couple of 
    years earlier. The other thing that remained consistent was the need to have the best Honda insurance plans for all the Activas that were bought.
    </p>

<h3 id="index5" style="font-size:30px">The 5th and the 6th Generations</h3>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The fifth and the sixth generation Activas were launched within short intervals. Th
    ere weren’t too many significant changes to the look and performance of the 5G Activa scooters from the earlier generations. The buil
    d quality was enhanced and the scooter was available in more colours. Also, the display panel was improved and LED lights were attached to the headlights
     and taillights. Soon, there was a mandate to follow the BS6 emission norms and so the Activa 6G was launched with a BS6 compliant engine. The other sig
     nificant addition was an external fuel lid which was in demand for a long time. 
    </p>

<h3 id="index6" style="font-size:30px">Honda Activa 125 – The most powerful Activa to date!</h3>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The Honda Activa 125 was launched in late 2019 and is defin
    itely the most powerful Activa model to date. It has a 125 credit card engine with 8.18hp of power and 10.3Nm of torque. The bike r
    esembles the 6G design to a large extent. It has a silent starter kit, which adds to the attractive list of features. The scooter is gaining in 
    popularity and continues to be one of the top-selling Activa models in the country. 
    </p> 

<h2>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp *CONCLUSION</h2>
